<h1 align="center">How to destroy a sign in form</h1>

Well, I was just about to give up on this sign-in form. But then it hit me: what is the worst way for people who have never used one of these before and are trying out an online service?
I'm going search high and low so you don't need spend your time fixing something that should be perfect in the first place!

## Error handling

Sometimes errors happen, but that's why we have error messages! Sometimes things get lost in translation and even though an application is supposed to do X thing for you - it may actually end up doing something else. Luckily enough these days developers know how important transparency with their users really can be so they're always eager to let people know what went wrong or successful completion of the task at hand upon request.

## Detailed fields

You know what? I'm all for it. It's not like we're going to use their credit card information or anything, so why don't you just put in our login data every time someone tries signing into an account? You never have any Idea how many people do this anyway and there might be some fraudsters trying out different things on your site! Plus if they want us as customers then who are really giving a crap about protecting themselves from something false anyways?

## Button text

Make your text as specific and clear to understand for the user.
A button is a great way of conveying information, but only if people know what they're getting themselves into before clicking on it! Make sure you use words that are easy enough so anyone can comprehend them--and remember: clarity beats complexity every time
